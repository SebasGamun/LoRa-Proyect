Project focused on the visualization and monitoring of 7 sensors using LoRa technology through the Grafana platform. The sensors communicate with a gateway, and packages are obtained from it using a Java program that decodes the payload to retrieve measurement information. Subsequently, this data is stored in a database created via the terminal using SQL. Grafana then retrieves the information from this database to display it visually.
